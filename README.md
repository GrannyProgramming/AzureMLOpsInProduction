# Introduction to Azure Machine Learning and MLOps

Azure Machine Learning is a comprehensive cloud-based machine learning service from Microsoft that offers capabilities for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It simplifies the process of creating models by providing an easy-to-use interface and a wide range of tools and services.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps, or DevOps for Machine Learning, brings together the best practices from the fields of machine learning and software development to help teams collaboratively build, validate, deliver, and monitor ML models. It helps to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline the deployment process.

## Applying MLOps in Azure 

With Azure Machine Learning, you can implement MLOps practices to automate and manage the lifecycle of your machine learning models. This includes the creation of reusable pipelines, automation of machine learning tasks, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of models, model versioning, and monitoring of model performance.

# Components of MLOps
 deleret
Here are some of the key components associated with MLOps in Azure:

1. **Data**: The raw material for any machine learning model. The quality and relevance of your data significantly impacts the model's performance.

2. **Model Training**: The process of teaching a model to make predictions by feeding it data. This usually involves selecting a suitable algorithm and tuning hyperparameters.

3. **Model Validation**: Checking the accuracy and reliability of the model by testing it on a separate set of data.

4. **Model Deployment**: Making the trained model available for use in a production environment.

5. **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to speed up the development process and reduce the chance of errors.

6. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: A set of practices that involve automatically building, testing, and deploying models to ensure they can be released to production at any time.

7. **Monitoring**: Continually checking the performance of models in production to detect any problems or changes in performance.

8. **Versioning**: Keeping track of different versions of models and data to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

9. **Infrastructure**: The hardware and software resources needed to run your machine learning workloads, which in the case of Azure Machine Learning, are provided as cloud services.

10. **Governance**: Policies and regulations that guide how machine learning models are developed and used, including data privacy and ethical considerations.

5. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: üó∫Ô∏è Once the repository is cloned, use the `cd` command to navigate into it:

    ```bash
    cd REPO_NAME
    ```

    Replace `REPO_NAME` with the name of the repository.

Now you're ready to run the `quickstart.ps1` script! üöÄ Remember, you'll need to pass the path to your JSON configuration file as an argument. 

# üöÄ Quickstart Guide 

Welcome to the **Quickstart Guide**! üéâ This document will assist you step by step to run the `quickstart.ps1` script. This incredible script helps in setting up various environments for your project using a provided JSON configuration file. 

## üìù What You'll Need

- **PowerShell**: üíª The command-line shell used to run the script. Pre-installed on most Windows machines, and available for [Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7.1) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1).

- **GitHub CLI**: Octocat's powerful tool, [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), is needed for this script. Make sure you have it installed on your machine.

- **Azure CLI**: ‚òÅÔ∏è Your gateway to Azure, the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), needs to be ready on your machine.

- **JSON Configuration File**: üóÇÔ∏è A JSON file that specifies the configurations for different environments (dev, test, prod). This guide assumes that you already have this file.

## üö¶ Steps

1. **Open PowerShell**: üîç Search for "PowerShell" in your computer's Start Menu (Windows) or Applications Folder (Mac), and click to open it.

2. **Navigate to the Script**: üó∫Ô∏è Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your `quickstart.ps1` script. If your script is in a folder named "scripts" on your desktop, you'd type `cd Desktop/scripts`.

3. **Run the Script**: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Type `.\quickstart.ps1 <PathToYourJsonFile>` to run the script. Replace `<PathToYourJsonFile>` with the path to your JSON file. If your JSON file is in the same "scripts" folder, you'd type `.\quickstart.ps1 my_config.json`.

    This magic script will:

    - Authenticate with GitHub
    - Extract the configuration details from your JSON file for each environment
    - Log in to Azure and set up the corresponding service principal for each environment
    - Gracefully update GitHub with the details for each environment and thier respective secrets

4. **Follow the Prompts**: üì¢ The script will guide you through the rest of the process. It might ask for your GitHub credentials (if you haven't logged in before) or ask to create a service principal in Azure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Help

If you encounter any issues, please check:

- ‚úîÔ∏è The path to your JSON file is correct.
- ‚úîÔ∏è You've installed all necessary tools (PowerShell, GitHub CLI, Azure CLI).
- ‚úîÔ∏è Your internet connection, as the script requires access to GitHub and Azure.

# üöÄ Running the GitHub Workflow

After setting up the service principal and GitHub secrets, you're ready to kick off the GitHub workflow. This workflow should be set up for manual triggering using `workflow_dispatch`. 

Here's how to do it using the GitHub CLI:

1. **List All Workflows**: üëÄ First, list all workflows available in your repository. In your terminal or PowerShell, type the following command:

    ```bash
    gh workflow list
    ```

    This will display a list of all workflows in your repository.

2. **Run the Workflow**: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Once you've identified the workflow you want to run, in our case the workflow will be called "Azure ML Workflow" you can dispatch it using the following command:

    ```bash
    gh workflow run WORKFLOW_NAME.yml
    ```

    Replace `WORKFLOW_NAME.yml` with the actual filename of your workflow i.e., "Azure ML Workflow".

3. **Check Workflow Status**: üìä To check the status of your workflow, use:

    ```bash
    gh run list
    ```

    This command will list all recent workflow runs, along with their status (completed, in-progress, failed, etc.)

## üñ•Ô∏è Checking Workflow Status via UI

If you prefer to visually check the status of your workflows, GitHub's user interface provides a detailed view of each workflow run. Here's how to access it:

1. **Go to Your Repository**: üîç Navigate to the main page of your repository on GitHub.

2. **Access Actions Tab**: üé¨ Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository page. This tab provides an overview of all workflow runs associated with your repository.

3. **View Workflow Runs**: üëÄ Here, you'll see a list of all runs for all workflows in your repository, with the most recent runs listed first. You can click on the name of a run to view more detailed information.

4. **Check Run Details**: üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Once you click on a specific run, you'll see a summary at the top of the page, and a detailed log of the run at the bottom. If the run is still in progress, you can watch the logs update in real-time.

That's it! You've successfully navigated to and viewed your workflow runs on GitHub. You can return to this page at any time to view the status of a run, or to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

üîß Remember, GitHub workflows are highly customizable. Always check the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository to understand what your workflows are doing and what inputs they might require.

## üöÄ Understanding the GitHub Actions Workflow

Your GitHub Actions Workflow, named `Azure ML Workflow`, is triggered whenever a push event is made to the `main` branch. It consists of several jobs, each with individual tasks or "steps".

1. **Checkout Code**: Utilizes the `actions/checkout@v3` action to clone the repository into the GitHub runner. This makes your entire codebase available for subsequent steps in the workflow.

2. **Set Up Python 3.9**: Leverages the `actions/setup-python@v4` action to set up a specific Python version (3.9) in the runner's environment. This ensures that all subsequent steps using Python are executed with the correct Python version.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Executes a Python script [`install_dependencies.py`](.github/utils/install_dependencies.py) that manages the installation of necessary Python packages and dependencies required for the rest of the workflow.

4. **Build Wheel And Install Helper Functions**: This step includes two tasks. First, it changes the current directory to where the Python wheel configurations are (`py_wheels`), then runs `setup.py` to build a wheel distribution of helper functions. Finally, it installs the generated wheel files, making these functions available for import in other scripts.

5. **Json Schema Validation**: Executes a Python script [`json_schema_validator.py`](.github/utils/json_schema_validator.py) to validate the structure of your JSON configuration files. This is crucial for ensuring data integrity and error prevention.

6. **Set Env Variables**: Executes a Python script [`set_env_variables.py`](.github/utils/set_env_variables.py) that sets environment variables for the runner based on parameters specified in a JSON file. This allows these variables to be used in subsequent steps.

7. **Azure Login**: This step authenticates with Azure using service principal credentials stored as GitHub secrets. This authenticated session is used for deploying resources and managing services within Azure in subsequent steps.

8. **Compile & Deploy Bicep Templates**: Compiles your Bicep infrastructure-as-code templates into ARM templates using the `bicep build` command. It then runs a Python script [`create_azure_resources.py`](.github/utils/create_azure_resources.py) to deploy these templates to Azure, effectively setting up your required cloud resources.

9. **Create AML Instance/Clusters**: Executes a Python script [`create_compute.py`](mlops/sdkv2/create_compute.py) to set up an Azure Machine Learning workspace and create associated compute clusters within it.

10. **Create An MLtable**: Executes a Python script [`createMlTable.py`](dataEngineer/nyc_taxi/src/createMlTable.py) to create a table in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, serving as a place to store and manage your ML data.

11. **Create Data Assets**: Executes a Python script [`create_data_asset.py`](mlops/sdkv2/create_data_asset.py) that creates data assets in Azure Machine Learning based on a provided JSON file. Data assets can include datasets, datastores, and more.

12. **Create AML Environments**: Executes a Python script [`create_environments.py`](mlops/sdkv2/create_environments.py) to create multiple Azure Machine Learning environments from a provided JSON file. These environments can then be used to run training scripts or host models.

13. **Create Components**: Executes a Python script [`create_component.py`](mlops/sdkv2/create_component.py) that creates pipeline components in Azure Machine Learning. These components define individual steps in the ML workflow, such as data preparation, model training, and model deployment.

14. **Create Pipelines**: Executes a Python script [`create_pipeline.py`](mlops/sdkv2/create_pipeline.py) to create ML pipelines in your Azure Machine Learning workspace. These pipelines orchestrate the execution of your ML workflow, using the components defined in the previous step.

15. **Create action groups**: Executes a Python script [`create_action_groups.py`](mlops/monitoring/azure_monitor/create_action_groups.py) to create Action Groups in Azure. Action Groups manage the notifications for alerts triggered by your Azure resources.

16. **Create alert processing rules based on severity**: Executes a script [`alert_processing_rules.py`](mlops/monitoring/azure_monitor/alert_processing_rules.py) to create rules in Azure Monitor. These rules define what actions to take when an alert with a specific severity is triggered.

17. **Create AML Alerts**: Executes a script [`create_alerts.py`](mlops/monitoring/azure_monitor/create_alerts.py) to create alerts in Azure Monitor. Alerts are triggered by specific conditions in your Azure resources, enabling proactive monitoring and management.

Each step in this workflow plays a crucial role in ensuring a successful execution of your MLOps pipeline. From setting up the correct environment and installing dependencies, to deploying resources in Azure, and even setting up alerts to monitor your resources - everything is automated and visible through GitHub Actions.
