# Contribution Guide
## Getting Started
First, you will need to set up the project on your own machine. For the detailed instructions on this, please refer to our README.md file.

## Choosing an Issue
Our issues are all listed on our GitHub page under the "Issues" tab. Each issue is tagged according to its nature (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.) and its difficulty level (good first issue, advanced, etc.). Feel free to pick an issue that interests you and is aligned with your skill level. If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with a "good first issue".

## Reporting a Bug or Suggesting an Enhancement
If you come across a bug that hasn't been reported, or have a suggestion for an enhancement, feel free to open a new issue. Make sure to provide a clear and concise description of the problem or suggestion. For bug reports, include steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, actual behavior, and any relevant error messages or screenshots.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Once you've made changes to the code, you can submit them for review as a pull request. Here's the process to do so:

1. Fork the repository: Create your own copy of the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository: Download the repository to your local machine using git clone.

3. Create a branch: Before you start making changes, create a new branch using git checkout -b branch_name.

4. Make your changes: Work on the issue you've chosen.

5. Commit your changes: Once you've made your changes, commit them with a clear and concise message describing what you've done.

6. Push your changes: Upload your changes to your forked repository using git push origin branch_name.

7. Create a pull request: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on "New Pull Request".

Make sure to link your pull request to the issue it resolves and describe the changes you made, why you made them, and any potential impacts they might have.
